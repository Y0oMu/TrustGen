Metadata Curator
================

Overview
--------

Metadata Curator is designed for intelligent data generation, combining web search, section-specific dataset generation, and model-based generation to create high-quality, diverse datasets for various research and application needs.

Components

BingWebSearchPipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``BingWebSearchPipeline`` automates the process of web searching and result processing. It extracts keywords from user input, performs a Bing search, and processes the results into JSON format.

:Parameters:
- :param **instruction**: (:type:`str`) A string that specifies the user's instruction for what to find on the web pages.
- :param **basic information**: (:type:`dict`) A dictionary that defines the specific information for the search.
- :param **need_azure**: (:type:`bool`) A boolean that indicates whether to use the Azure API for generating responses.
- :param **output_format**: (:type:`dict`) A dictionary that outlines the structure of the expected results.
- :param **keyword_model**: (:type:`str`) The model to use for generating keywords (e.g., "gpt-4o").
- :param **response_model**: (:type:`str`) The model to use for generating responses (e.g., "gpt-4o").
- :param **include_url**: (:type:`bool`) A boolean that indicates whether to include the URL of the web pages in the output.
- :param **include_summary**: (:type:`bool`) A boolean that indicates whether to include a summary of the web pages in the output.
- :param **include_original_html**: (:type:`bool`) A boolean that indicates whether to include the original HTML of the web pages in the output.
- :param **include_access_time**: (:type:`bool`) A boolean that indicates whether to include the access time of the web pages in the output.
- :param **output_file**: (:type:`str`) A string that specifies the name of the output file where the results will be saved.
- :param **direct_search_keyword**: (:type:`str`, optional) Direct keyword for the search. If provided, this keyword will be used directly.
- :param **direct_site**: (:type:`str`, optional) Specific site to search within. If provided, the search will be limited to this site. If there are multiple specified websites, please separate them with commas, for example `"www.wikipedia.com,www.nytimes.com"`.

BingImageSearchPipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``BingImageSearchPipeline`` automates the process of extracting keywords from user input, performing a Bing image search, and processing the results into JSON format.

:Parameters:
- :param **instruction**: (:type:`str`) A string that specifies the user's instruction for what kind of images to find.
- :param **basic_information**: (:type:`dict`) A dictionary that defines the specific information for the search (e.g., breed of dog, age, etc.).
- :param **output_path**: (:type:`str`, optional) A string that specifies the name of the output file where the results will be saved. Defaults to "processed_image_results.json".
- :param **keyword_model**: (:type:`str`) The model to use for generating keywords (e.g., "gpt-4o").
- :param **include_access_time**: (:type:`bool`, optional) A boolean that indicates whether to include the access time of the web pages in the output. Defaults to ``True``.
- :param **direct_search_keyword**: (:type:`str`, optional) Direct keyword for the search. If provided, this keyword will be used directly.

Dataset Pool Maintainer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dataset pool maintainer component is a mechanism for creating diverse and enriched test sets by leveraging section-specific pipelines. Each section (such as safety, ethics, fairness) contains its own pipeline for generating targeted test datasets.

.. note::
   - **Section-Specific Generation**: Each research section has a dedicated pipeline for generating relevant test datasets.
   - **Targeted Data Creation**: Pipelines focus on producing datasets specific to their domain's unique requirements.
   - **Diversity and Representation**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of potential scenarios.

**Workflow**

1. **Section Selection**: Choose a specific research section (e.g., safety, ethics, robustness).
2. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - Navigate to the section's directory.
   - Run the section's ``pipeline.py``.
   - Generate a domain-specific test dataset.

**Available Sections**

- Safety
- Ethics
- Fairness
- Privacy
- Robustness
- Truthfulness

Model-based Data Generators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Model-based data generators component leverages advanced language models to directly generate synthetic data. This approach provides a flexible and powerful method for creating datasets tailored to specific requirements.

.. note::
   - **Direct Model Invocation**: Call generation services to produce data.
   - **Configurable Generation Parameters**: Customize the generation process.
   - **Support for Multiple Model Services**: Compatible with various model services.

**Usage**

For detailed instructions on using the model service, refer to the `ModelService documentation <Evaluation.md>`_.
